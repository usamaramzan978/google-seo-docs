Package tracking is a feature that displays package tracking related information on Google. When
people come to Search looking to track a package shipped with your company, they'll be able to
enter a package ID directly. The feature uses your API to retrieve the package tracking
information and then displays it to the user.

## Feature availability

Package tracking is available in all languages and countries where Google Search is available.
The program is no longer accepting new partners.
